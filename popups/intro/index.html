    <h3>Ready to Get Started?</h3>
    <p>Once you close out this intro, you can come back to it later by clicking on the question mark (?) in the upper right. The scenario will start, and you will receive your first challenge. Look around the room, pay attention to the areas with a pulsing yellow halo and, if you feel lost, use the process map in the upper right to get a hint as to what you should be doing next.</p>
    <p>Good Luck!</p>
